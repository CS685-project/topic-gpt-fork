You will receive a document and a set of topics, generally pertaining to electrical systems, that were found in previous documents. Your task is to identify such topics within the given document. If any relevant topics are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level topics from the document.

[Topics]
{Topics}


[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Diodes", "[1] Semiconductors", and "[1] Insulators".
[Abstract]
Light detecting structures comprising germanium (Ge) photodiodes formed in a device layer of a germanium on-insulator (GeOI) wafer, focal planes arrays based on such Ge photodiodes (PDs) and methods for fabricating such Ge photodiodes and focal plane arrays (FPAs). An FPA includes a Ge-on-GeOI PD array bonded to a ROIC where the handle layer of the GeOI layer is removed. The GeOI insulator properties and thickness can be designed to improve light coupling into the PDs.
[Your response]
[1] Diodes: Mentions diodes as components in electrical circuits.
[1] Semiconductors: Describes a type of semiconductor material.
[1] Insulators: Discusses insulator materials or design.

Example 2: Returning "None".
[Abstract]
A gear lubricant line device includes a base body configured to attach to an end surface of a gear and a mount including a holder for a lubricant applicator. The mount is slidably mounted on the base body and releasably fixable to the base body to hold the lubricant applicator in a desired position relative to a tooth base of the gear.
[Your response]
None

Example 3: Adding "[1] Electrolytes", "[1] Semiconductors", and "[1] Fuel Cells".
[Abstract]
Provided is a solid electrolyte laminate comprising a solid electrolyte layer having proton conductivity and a cathode electrode layer laminated on one side of the solid electrolyte layer and made of lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide (LSC). Also provided is a method for manufacturing the solid electrolyte. This solid electrolyte laminate can further comprise an anode electrode layer made of nickel-yttrium doped barium zirconate (Ni\u2014BZY). This solid electrolyte laminate is suitable for a fuel cell operating in an intermediate temperature range less than or equal to 600\u00b0 C.
[Your response]
[1] Electrolytes: Pertains to a solid or liquid electrolyte material.
[1] Semiconductors: Describes a type of semiconductor material.
[1] Fuel Cells: Mentions a fuel cell architecture or application.

Example 4: Returning "[1] Sensors".
[Abstract]
A rotational positioning system in a wind turbine is provided that comprises a driven part, a plurality of positioning drives coupled to the driven part, a plurality of sensors each arranged to sense a load parameter indicative of the load of the respective positioning drive, and a load controller connected to the plurality of sensors. The load controller is arranged to determine a load of a respective positioning drive based on the sensed load parameter, to compare said load with an expected load value, and to output a signal indicative of a failure of the respective positioning drive in response to the load being smaller than the expected load value.
[Your response]
[1] Sensors: Relates to sensing elements that measure physical or environmental parameters.

Example 5: Returning "None".
[Abstract]
A method of predicting vehicle engine torque using an artificial neural network is provided. A data-based artificial neural network model is applied to more accurately calculate torque and reduce development costs for calibration and logics.
[Your response]
None

Example 6: Adding "[1] Inverters".
[Abstract]
A double-stage inverter apparatus for energy conversion systems (FIG. 1) and control method thereof, adapted to manage the operations of the on-board booster module so as to optimize the overall electrical efficiency of the system. Furthermore, the method according to the present invention allows the operations of said double-stage inverter to be managed when there is only one input channel, when there are multiple input channels called to operate both in parallel and also when there are multiple input channels called to operate independently from each other.
[Your response]
[1] Inverters: Describes a device that converts direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) or vice versa.


[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine if the abstract generally pertains to electrical systems. If so, extract topics in the style of the examples above.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must be described by a level number, a short general label, and a description: "[<level>] <label> <description>". 
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
- If there are already duplicates of the topics in the hierarchy, output those topics. 
- Otherwise, output the identified topics.
- If the document contains no topic that fits in with the previously generated topics, return "None".
