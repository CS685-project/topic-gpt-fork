[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine PRIMARY and GENERALIZABLE topics mentioned in the documents. 
- The topics must be generalizable among the provided documents. 
- Each topic must not be too specific so that it can accommodate future subtopics.
- Each topic must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- Each top-level topic must have a level number and a short label. Second-level topics should also include the original documents associated with these topics (separated by commas) as well as a short description of the topic.
- The number of topics proposed cannot exceed the number of documents provided.
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations: 
1. If the provided top-level topic is specific enough, DO NOT add any subtopics. Return the provided top-level topic.
2. If your topic is duplicate or relevant to the provided topics, DO NOT add any subtopics. Return the existing relevant topic. 
3. If your topic is relevant to and more specific than the provided top-level topic, add your topic as a second-level topic. DO NOT add to the first or third level of the hierarchy.
