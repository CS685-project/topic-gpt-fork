You will receive a document and a set of top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable topics within the document that can act as top-level topics in the hierarchy. If any relevant topics are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level topics as identified in the document.

[Top-level topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: New topic "[1] Healtcare"
Document: 
A smart wearable device for continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. This innovative wearable device integrates biosensors and wireless technology to provide real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels in diabetic individuals. The device is worn discreetly on the body and continuously measures glucose levels from interstitial fluid, eliminating the need for frequent finger pricks. The data is transmitted wirelessly to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their glucose levels and receive timely alerts for hypo- or hyperglycemic events. With its non-invasive monitoring and user-friendly interface, this device improves diabetes management and enhances quality of life for patients.

Your response: 
[1] Healthcare Technology: Technological improvement or innovation with applications in healthcare.

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] Healthcare", returning the existing topic
Document: 
A new drug delivery system based on biodegradable nanoparticles for targeted cancer therapy. This innovative drug delivery system utilizes biodegradable nanoparticles as carriers to transport anticancer drugs to tumor sites with precision and efficiency. By encapsulating drugs within nanoparticles, the system enhances their solubility, stability, and bioavailability, while minimizing off-target effects and reducing systemic toxicity. The nanoparticles can be functionalized with targeting ligands to selectively bind to cancer cells, allowing for targeted drug delivery and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. With its potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce side effects, this system represents a promising approach to cancer treatment.

Your response: 
[1] Healthcare Technology: Technological improvement or innovation with applications in healthcare.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in the document. 
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a level number, a short general label, and a topic description. 
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations: 
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here. 
2. If the document contains no topic, return "None". 
3. Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.
