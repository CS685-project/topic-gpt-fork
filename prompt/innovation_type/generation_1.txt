You will receive a document and a set of top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable topics within the document that can act as top-level topics in the hierarchy. If any relevant topics are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level topics as identified in the document.

[Top-level topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]

Example 1: Adding "[1] Operational Mobility" and "[1] Operational Flexibility"
[Document]
A mobile steel grit dryer used to dry steel grit may be configured with a number of different functions and features to assist a contractor in performing steel or other structure maintenance when using steel grit in resurfacing the structure. The steel grit dryer may be configured with a heat process vacuum bypass so that an off-board vacuum, such as a vacuum on a grit recycling system, may be utilized as opposed to having an onboard vacuum. The dryer may include multiple modes so that an operator may use different modes for different environmental conditions. An exoframe may provide for better durability when being transported to different jobsites. A variety of automation and safety features may also be provided to simplify and improve safety for operators.
[Your response]
[1] Operational Mobility: Innovation pertaining to the improvement of mobility when executing a task.
[1] Operational Flexibility: Improvement of flexibility of an operation in a business or manufacturing environment. 

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] Trade", returning the existing topic
[Document]
Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to suspend temporarily the duty on mixtures containing Fluopyram.
[Your response]
[1] Trade: Mentions the exchange of capital, goods, and services.


[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in the document. 
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a level number, a short general label, and a topic description. 
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
- If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here. 
- If the document contains no topic, return "None".
- Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.

You must ONLY return the relevant or modified topics at the top level in the hierarchy. The topics must follow the following pattern: "[<level>] <label> <description>".
Hint: the topics should reflect the nature of the innovation that the document proposes.
