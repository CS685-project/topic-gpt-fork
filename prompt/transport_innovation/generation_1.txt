[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] CO2 production".
[Document]
A method for removing carbon dioxide directly from ambient air, using a sorbent under ambient conditions, to obtain relatively pure CO2. The CO2 is removed from the sorbent using process heat, preferably in the form of steam, at a temperature in the range of not greater than about 130Â° C., to capture the relatively pure CO2 and to regenerate the sorbent for repeated use. Increased efficiency can be achieved by admixing with the ambient air, prior to contacting the sorbent, a minor amount of a preferably pretreated effluent gas containing a higher concentration of carbon dioxide. The captured carbon dioxide can be stored for further use, or sequestered permanently. The above method provides purified carbon dioxide for further use in agriculture and chemical processes, or for permanent sequestration.

[Document]
Carbon dioxide is recovered from gas mixtures containing it in a concentration not greater than the equilibrium concentration at the freezing temperature of the mixture, by subjecting the gas mixture to membrane separation and recovering from the membrane separation a permeate having a carbon dioxide concentration between the equilibrium concentration and 98% (by volume), distilling said permeate at subambient temperature above the freezing temperature of the permeate and recovering substantially pure carbon dioxide as a liquid bottoms product of the distillation. Carbon dioxide is recovered from gas mixtures containing it in a high concentration by supplying the gas mixture at superatmospheric pressure and distilling said gas mixture at sub-ambient temperature in a distillation column, recovering substantially pure carbon dioxide as a liquid bottoms product of the distillation, warming the overhead stream from the distillation to a temperature suitable for membrane separation, passing the overhead stream at superatmospheric pressure over a membrane which is selectively permeable for carbon dioxide and thereafter recycling carbon dioxide-rich permeate for recompression and feeding to the distillation column.

Example 3: Adding "[1] Fuel combustion".
[Document]
In an attempt to regenerate energy of exhaust gas by using a pressure regenerator secured to an exhaust port of a displacement type engine so as to realize the Atkinson's cycle, if the engine is a four-cycle engine, raising regenerative pressure may cause abnormal fuel combustion or melting damage of an exhaust valve. The present invention has successfully solved this problem by using a six-cycle engine. The six-cycle engine with a regenerator according to the present invention is capable of varying proportion of the power output that is generated by the six-cycle engine itself and that is generated by the regenerator. Using this principle enables the six-cycle engine with a generator to be used as an engine that is capable of generating two kinds of output power or as a six-cycle gas turbine with high controllability. The invented internal combustion engine is excellent and valuable in the fuel cost economy when it is used as a motor for a power station and a small generator as well as a motor for a movable body such as a ship or a vehicle. The invented internal combustion engine is especially suitable for a movable body such as a hybrid-system vehicle. Incidentally, the inventor is ready for granting the rights for practicing the present invention.

Example 4: Adding "[1] Energy system optimization".
[Document]
The invention relates to a method for real-time scheduling of multi-energy complementary micro-grids based on a Rollout algorithm, which is technically characterized by comprising the following steps of: Step 1, setting up a moving-horizon Markov decision process model for the real-time scheduling of the multi-energy complementary micro-grids with random new-energy outputs, and establishing constraint conditions for the real-time scheduling; Step 2, establishing a target function of the real-time scheduling; Step 3, dividing a single complete scheduling cycle into a plurality of scheduling intervals, and finding one basic feasible solution meeting the constraint conditions for the real-time scheduling based on a greedy algorithm; and Step 4, finding a solution to the moving-horizon Markov decision process model for the real-time scheduling of the multi-energy complementary micro-grids by using the Rollout algorithm based on the basic feasible solution from Step 3. With the consideration of the fluctuations in the new-energy outputs, the present invention solves the problems of low speed and low efficiency of a traditional algorithm at the same time, enabling high-speed efficient multi-energy complementary micro-grid real-time scheduling.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine innovation types mentioned in the document. 
- The type(s) must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The type(s) must reflect a SINGLE type instead of a combination of types.
- The new type(s) must have a level number, a short general label, and a type description. 
- The types must be broad enough to accommodate future subtypes. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
- If there are already duplicates of the innovation types in the hierarchy, output those types and do not add any new types. 
- If the document does not contain clear innovation types, return "None".
- Otherwise, add your type. Stop here and output the added type(s). DO NOT add any additional levels. The types must follow the following pattern: "[<level>] <label> <description>".
