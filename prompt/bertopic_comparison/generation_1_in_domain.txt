You will receive a document and a set of top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable topics within the document that can act as top-level topics in the hierarchy. If any relevant topics are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level topics as identified in the document.

[Top-level topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Tools".
[Document]
A mobile steel grit dryer used to dry steel grit may be configured with a number of different functions and features to assist a contractor in performing steel or other structure maintenance when using steel grit in resurfacing the structure. The steel grit dryer may be configured with a heat process vacuum bypass so that an off-board vacuum, such as a vacuum on a grit recycling system, may be utilized as opposed to having an onboard vacuum. The dryer may include multiple modes so that an operator may use different modes for different environmental conditions. An exoframe may provide for better durability when being transported to different jobsites. A variety of automation and safety features may also be provided to simplify and improve safety for operators.
[Your response]
[1] Tools: Metions a novel or improved tool.
Example 2: Adding "[1] Biological Processes".
[Document]
Provided herein are methods for using RNAi molecules targeting a proteasome beta 5 (PSMB5) gene for controlling Coleopteran insects, methods for producing RNAi molecules targeting PSMB5, and compositions comprising RNAi molecules targeting PSMB5.
[Your response]
[1] Biological Processes: Pertains to the discovery or development of biological processes for practical applications.
Example 3: Adding "[1] Materials".
[Document]
Capacitor comprising: a first porous semiconductor having an average pore size of between 20 nm and 200 nm and preferably between 40 nm and 100 nm, at least one second electric conductor, wherein the second electric conductor infiltrates the porous structure, and the materials involved are selected such that a potential barrier is formed between the first porous semiconductor and the second conductor, without applying an external voltage, as a result of the diffusion of charge carriers, which is preferably more than 0.5 V, more preferably more than 0.7 V, more preferably more than 1 V, and more preferably still more than 1.4 V, wherein a dielectric layer having a thickness of 1 nm to 10 nm is preferably arranged between the first porous semiconductor and the second electric conductor.
[Your response]
[1] Materials: Introduces a novel or improved material with desireable properties.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in the document. 
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a level number, a short general label, and a topic description. 
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics. 
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
- If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here. 
- If the document contains no topic, return "None".
- Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.

You must ONLY return the relevant or modified topics at the top level in the hierarchy. The topics must follow the following pattern: "[<level>] <label> <description>".
