The wingtip torque box may include internal grid stiffeners and\/or external stiffeners that may be also monolithic with other components of the box. For example, the stiffeners may be machined in spars or skin portions of the clamshells during fabrication of clamshells. The wingtip torque box may have a continuous cavity extending between the ends and, in some embodiments, between spars of the box and providing access for performing various operations inside the box.","label":["B64C 3\/18","B64C 23\/065","B64C 3\/20","B64C 3\/185","B64C 3\/26","B64C 3\/182","B64F 5\/10","B23K 20\/1265","B23K 20\/2336","B23K 2101\/12","B23K 2103\/10","C25D 11\/04","Y02T 50\/164"],"responses":" [1] Aviation Technology: Mentions aircraft technology, specifically wingtip torque boxes and their fabrication methods.\n[1] Manufacturing: Mentions fabrication processes, specifically friction stir welding and monolithic clamshells.\n[1] Engineering Design: Mentions design of wingtip torque boxes and their components, including internal and external stiffeners.\n[1] Material Processing: Mentions the processing of materials, specifically the fabrication of monolithic clamshells and the use of friction stir welding.\n[1] Composite Materials: Mentions the use of monolithic clamshells and the potential inclusion of internal and external stiffeners, which may be composite materials."}
