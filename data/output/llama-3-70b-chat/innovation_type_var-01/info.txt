Same trial as innovation_type (altered prompt, no seed topics). 
Prompt is only changed in one way: "type(s)" replaced with "types"

Theory:
- Shows sensitivity of the prompt to small changes

Results:
- Does actually change the topics a bit, but confusing
- Hard to interpret
- Does not seem to affect the number of assigned topics per document, but this might be a bug in the framework! 
--> Looked like it did in the initial output of the generation... could investigate but maybe not high-prio enough
