{"id":"US-11072536-B2","text":"The present invention discloses a method and a process of producing ammonia from methane extracted from methane-hydrate at the site of methane-hydrate extraction. The method and the process comprise coupled chemical reactions. During the first reaction, carbon dioxide reacts methane-hydrate to produce carbon-dioxide-hydrate and methane: carbon dioxide+methane-hydrate\u21c4carbon-dioxide-hydrate+methane (CO2+CH4-hydrate\u21c4CO2-hydrate+CH4). The produced methane is reacted with water to produced carbon dioxide and hydrogen via the second reaction: methane+water\u21c4carbon dioxide+hydrogen (CH4+2H2O\u21c4CO2+4H2). One embodiment of the second reaction is a combination of the methane steam reforming reaction (CH4+H2O\u21c4CO+3H2) and the water-gas shift reaction (CO+H2O\u21c4CO2+H2), both are widely known in the art. The carbon dioxide produced in the second reaction is recycled and used for the first reaction. The hydrogen produced in the second reaction is reacted with nitrogen produced from an air separation process that is known in the art to produce ammonia via the third reaction: nitrogen+hydrogen\u2192ammonia (N2+3H2\u21922NH3). One embodiment of the third reaction is the well-known Haber-Bosch process. The current invention is related to co-locating the ammonia synthesis at the methane-hydrate extraction sites to minimize the cost of transporting both methane and carbon dioxide over long distances. The process and the associated method also have the advantage of on-site carbon sequestration. The ammonia product produced via the current invention is easily transportable in liquid form from the production sites to the end-use sites as a carbon-free liquid fuel, a fertilizer and a chemical feedstock.","label":["C01B 2203\/0233","C01B 2203\/0283","C01B 2203\/068","C01B 2203\/1241","C01B 3\/025","C01B 3\/48","C01C 1\/0405","C07C 7\/00","Y02P 20\/52","B01D 53\/1475"],"responses":"[1] Materials: Describes the invention or innovative application of a specific material.\n[1] Manufacturing: Mentions manufacturing processes.\n[1] Thermal Management: Pertains to the management of heat or temperature in a system or process."}

Due to current pandemic scenario many organizations eventually need to plan for the return of employees to office space ensuring biosafety. The challenge of maximizing the office space utilization ensuring occupants biosafety and comfort thereby minimizing HVAC energy consumption is necessary. The method utilizes two heuristic approaches for determining maximum allowable occupants placement in the open plan space using an optimal occupant placement technique. This minimizes the HVAC energy if the actual count is lesser than the possible maximum occupants can be placed which further optimizes energy using a joint actuator control technique. Additionally, the proposed two heuristic approaches improve space utilization for the infection rate ensuring bio safety. Full utilization of open plan space is possible when the community infection rate and exposure duration are relatively low resulting low risk probability for uninfected occupants.","label":["F24F 11\/63","F24F 11\/46","F24F 2120\/12","F24F 2140\/50","F24F 2140\/60","F24F 2110\/65","F24F 2120\/10","Y02B 30\/70","G06Q 10\/06375","G06Q 50\/06","G06Q 10\/0635"],"responses":"[1] Algorithms: Mentions the invention or application of an innovative algorithm.\n\nNote: The document mentions the use of heuristic approaches, which are a type of algorithm, to optimize occupant placement and energy consumption."}

The magnitude of a current flowing through the load is sensed and compared to a reference magnitude to produce a feedback signal. The feedback signal controls a voltage superposition circuit, which produces a superposition voltage. The superposition voltage is applied to an input node of a current control circuit. The current control circuit responds to the superposition voltage to vary a magnitude of a control current to a switching controller in the DC to-AC inverter.
