In one implementation, a method includes establishing a communication connection with each of multiple electric resources connected to a power grid, receiving an energy generation signal from a power grid operator, and controlling a number of the electric resources being charged by the power grid as a function of the energy generation signal.', 'A method for controlling an operating condition of an electric power grid, the electric power grid having an intermittent power supply coupled thereto, the method comprising: using an energy variability controller, controlling variability of a delivered power output of the intermittent power supply to the electric power grid by: monitoring an actual environmental value for a location proximate the intermittent power supply, an available power output of the intermittent power supply being dependent on the actual environmental value; when the actual environmental value is increasing and hence the available power output is increasing, increasing the delivered power output according to a predetermined rate of increase; monitoring a forecast environmental value for the location; when the forecast environmental value is decreasing, decreasing the delivered power output according to a predetermined rate of decrease; and, limiting the delivered power output to below a predetermined threshold.', 'A method and system for supplying electric power to a plurality of priority loads from either a utility power source or a secondary power source, such as a generator. A control unit monitors the power draw by each of a plurality of priority loads and base loads during the supply of electric power from the utility power source. When the supply of power from the utility power source is interrupted, the control unit determines the number of the priority loads that can be powered by the secondary power source based on the monitored power draw of the priority and base loads prior to power interruption. The secondary power source is activated and the determined number of priority loads is immediately connected to the secondary power source without delay. When the utility power source returns, the system and method transfers utility power back to all of the priority and base loads.']"
