Same prompt as the baseline innovation_type trial, except I replaced "type(s)" with "types".
No seed topics.
Newly generated topics are not added to the prompt --> robustness property.

Theory:
- Robust to document order
- Task complexity is invariant to the number of documents
- No dilution of seed topic impact (though I did not use seed topics)

Result:
- Creates a lot more topics than the non-robust trial
- Topics are better imo, because the non-robust trial is heavily biased towards the "systems" category
--> Check for some examples if systems makes sense!!!
