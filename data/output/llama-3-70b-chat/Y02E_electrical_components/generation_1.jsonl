To reduce the effect of common-mode noise, a capacitor is connected between the 1 neutral conductor 7 and earth, and a respective filter circuit 30 is connected between each of the a.c. outputs of the inverters 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d and earth. To reduce the effect of voltage surges during lightning, a surge protection device is also connected between the neutral d.c. conductor 7 and earth. Any imbalance in the current in the positive and negative conductors 6, 8 is compensated by detecting the presence of current flowing in the neutral conductor 7. Power supplied to auxiliary circuits from the output of one of the inverters, e.g. 10a, of the wind turbine is measured, and any resulting imbalance between the current in the positive and negative conductors is compensated. In the event of an earth-leakage fault in the conductors connecting the a.c. outputs of the inverters to the grid, when isolated, isolation detection relays 25 are provided.","label":["H02M 5\/42","H02M 1\/12","H02M 1\/32","H02M 7\/493","H02M 5\/4585","H02M 7\/219","H02M 7\/23","H02M 2001\/123","H02M 2001\/0077","H02M 2007\/4822","F03D 9\/255","H03H 7\/0107","H02H 3\/105","H02H 7\/122","H02J 3\/28","H02J 3\/386","Y02E 70\/30","Y02E 10\/763","Y02E 10\/725","Y02E 10\/766","Y02E 10\/726","G01R 31\/40"],"responses":"[1] Wind Turbines: Relates to wind turbine architecture or application.\n[1] Inverters: Describes devices that convert direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) or vice versa.\n[1] Rectifiers: Mentions devices that convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).\n[1] Power Generation and Distribution Systems: Pertains to systems that generate and distribute electrical power.\n[1] Electrical Conductors: Discusses conductors used in electrical systems.\n[1] Surge Protection Devices: Relates to devices that protect against voltage surges.\n[1] Filters: Mentions devices that filter electrical signals.\n[1] Electrical Grids: Pertains to systems that distribute electrical power to consumers."}

The exciting pump pulses are directed into a lookthrough compression arrangement wherein they energize a stimulated scattering process in low pressure (about 1 atmosphere) gaseous media and impinge in an off axis backward geometry. The extraction pulse is formed and directed towards the target with the appropriate information (color, phase, desired irradiance pattern) impressed on it at relatively low energy by manipulation with conventional, solid material optical elements. Once formed, it traverses the gaseous media, is amplified, and proceeds through a vacuum transition section and onto the target. After the injection of the extraction pulse into the lookthrough compression arrangement, it is amplified in the gaseous media by conversion of the pump energy, coupled through the scattering process. The media and the pump and extraction pulses are tailored to give high energy gain to the input optical pulse, high output fluence, good beam quality (high fidelity amplification to the desired temporal and spatial shape), and time compression. Once injected into the entrance to the first section by the material elements, the extraction pulse proceeds through shutter areas that separate different media regions and encounter no further solid material optical elements as it travels to the target. The focus on the target is impressed before amplification and time compression from the pump pulses and results in a very high brightness irradiance of the target. The desired spatial pattern of irradiance on the target is likewise formed with material elements and then imaged onto the target. Fluences some 2-3 orders of magnitude above those available under the conventional art may be thus obtained with an output brightness better by some six orders of magnitude.","label":["H01S 3\/305","H01S 3\/0057","H01S 3\/2391","H01S 3\/2316","Y02E 30\/14"],"responses":"[1] Laser: Relates to the use of laser technology in an apparatus and process for pumping laser media."}

One DC input polarity is selectively switched to an output terminal when the instantaneous AC output from a second output terminal is desired to be of the opposite polarity, while the other DC input polarity is used to form an approximation to a segment of a sine wave of the desired polarity at the second output terminal. The approximation for each phase is built in a multilevel fashion by outputting, at different times, voltage levels that differ by an integer multiple of a predetermined voltage step size, to the respective live AC output terminal through an associated low pass filter.

Multiple sets of modular, shop assembled storage tanks are also used to reduce the amount of salt piping, simplify draining, and reduce field assembly and plant cost.","label":["F03G 6\/067","F24J 2002\/1076","F24J 2\/07","F24J 2\/4607","F24J 2\/4621","F24J 2\/4636","F24J 2\/4649","F28D 2020\/0047","F28D 1\/0426","F28D 1\/05333","F28D 20\/0034","F28D 20\/021","Y02E 10\/41","Y02E 10\/46","Y02E 10\/44","Y02E 60\/142","Y02E 60\/145","F22B 1\/006"],"responses":"[1] Solar Energy Systems: Describes a system that harnesses energy from the sun.\n[1] Heat Exchangers: Pertains to devices that transfer heat from one fluid to another.\n[1] Thermal Storage Systems: Relates to systems that store thermal energy for later use.\n[1] Power Generation and Distribution Systems: Mentions systems that generate and distribute power.\n[1] Thermal Desalination: Describes a process that uses heat to remove salt and other minerals from seawater."}
