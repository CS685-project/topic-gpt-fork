On the other hand, when the device temperature is lower than the reference temperature, air that has received heat from the electrical storage device is guided to a discharge chamber by driving the fan at an air quantity smaller than the reference air quantity on the basis of the fact that an air-conditioning system is operating and an outside air temperature is lower than or equal to a predetermined temperature. When the air-conditioning system is operating and the outside air temperature is lower than or equal to the predetermined temperature, it is assumed that there is a temperature difference between a passenger compartment and the discharge chamber. At this time, by driving the fan at the air quantity smaller than the reference air quantity, it is possible to bring the temperature of the discharge chamber close to the temperature of the passenger compartment by raising the temperature of the discharge chamber, so it is possible to reduce the temperature difference between the discharge chamber and the passenger compartment.","label":["B60H 1\/00278","B60H 1\/00392","B60H 1\/00828","B60H 1\/00885","B60H 1\/143","B60H 2001\/003","B60L 50\/66","B60L 58\/21","B60L 50\/51","B60L 58\/26","B60L 1\/003","B60L 7\/14","B60L 2240\/34","B60L 2240\/224036","B60L 2240\/545","Y02T 10\/70"]}

At least a portion of the anode exhaust can be recycled for use as a fuel for the combustion source. Optionally, a second portion of the anode exhaust can be recycled for use as part of an anode input stream. This can allow for a reduction in the amount of fuel cell area required for separating CO2 from the combustion source exhaust and\/or modifications in how the fuel cells can be operated.","label":["H01M 8\/06","H01M 8\/0687","H01M 8\/04","H01M 8\/048","H01M 8\/04111","H01M 8\/0612","H01M 8\/145","H01M 8\/0625","H01M 8\/0668","H01M 8\/0618","H01M 8\/04761","H01M 8\/04097","H01M 8\/0662","H01M 8\/14","H01M 8\/04805","H01M 8\/04156","H01M 2300\/0051","F02C 6\/18","F02C 3\/22","C07C 1\/0485","C07C 29\/152","C07C 29\/1518","C01B 3\/16","C01B 3\/48","C01B 3\/34","C01B 3\/50","C01B 2203\/1241","C01B 2203\/0205","C01B 15\/00","C10G 2\/34","C10G 2\/332","C25B 3\/02","C21B 15\/00","C10K 3\/04","C04B 7\/367","Y02E 20\/14","Y02E 50\/18","Y02E 60\/566","Y02E 60\/50","Y02E 60\/563","Y02T 10\/16"]}
